# LagerPi
Originally intended as a thermo-electric controller for lagering beer, the LagerPi project has become more ambitious but lost much of it's development time.

If you're looking at the code and you've got complaints or it's written in a way that frustrates you, it's because I'm very inconsistent. Hell, even my comment style is varied. It's all very slapdash, but it works.

Feel free to suggest any changes, call me dumb, whatever you like. I'll give it all careful consideration and make what changes I feel like I need.
